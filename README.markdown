Troubleshooting
----------------------

If the program crashes it's likely due to no internet connection, being behind a proxy (no proxy support yet), or bad login information.

This is by no means a polished program - very little error control is present - but given the nature of the Beanstalk API this means crashes are possible, not mistaken deployments.
